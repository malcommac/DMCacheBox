# DMCacheBox

DMCacheBox is a fast & advanced caching system for Objective-C (Cocoa/iOS compatible).
You can use it to cache generic data and it contains several utils methods to store and retrive UIImage/NSImage or Plist files.
DMCacheBox was created to be fast and lightweight: data is written asynchronously and if you want you can keep in touch with data write progresses.
